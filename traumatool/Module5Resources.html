  <li><a href="http://www.chcs.org/media/Children-in-Foster-Care-Behavioral-Health-Care-Use-in-Medicaid5.jpg" target="_blank">Children in Foster Care: Behavioral Health Care use in Medicaid</a>. Many children in the nation’s foster care system – nearly one in three – use behavioral health services. This population represents only three percent of all children in Medicaid, but 15 percent of those using behavioral health services and 29 percent of Medicaid expenditures for children’s behavioral health services. This infographic from the Center for Health Care Strategies (CHCS) compares behavioral health care use and expense for Medicaid-enrolled children in general vs. those in foster care. The graphic is a companion to a CHCS <a href="http://www.chcs.org/resource/medicaid-behavioral-health-care-use-among-children-foster-care/" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> that details behavioral health care use and expense for this high-need population.

The Community Health Resilience Toolset was developed through a CHR Initiative in a year-long, rigorous, stakeholder-driven project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Health Affairs (DHS/OHA) in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and with representatives from other Federal partners, state and local agencies, and private sector and non-profit organizations from across the Nation.

  <li><a href="http://communityresiliencecookbook.org/" target="_blank">Community Resilience Cookbook</a>. When people learn about the ACE Study, they have a range of reactions, from sorrow to outrage to relief at having a framework—finally—that explains their own or others’ behavior. Then they ask, “What can I do?” This cookbook aims to answer that question. Whether you are the director of a YMCA, the head of a county health department, a sheriff, a school principal, a pediatrician or a parent, it will offer you context, definitions and questions to help you think about building resilience where you live. It will describe how communities in the United States and Canada are putting the theories of ACEs and resilience into practice.</li>

These are core cognitive, emotional, and behavioral skills required for peaceful, productive, healthy and happy lives.  PAX is not a classroom or behavior management program, yet has the benefit of making any classroom easier to manage. PAX reduces teacher and staff stress, and brings back joy into the classroom every day—while increasing time for meaningful instruction and learning. Watch the videos at http://paxis.org/news/videos to learn more about PAX in action, and listen to the teachers, administrators and students speak up.</li>

Philadelphia Inquirer (Blog), Jonathan Purtle, 03/21/2014. This blog is part of a serious of posts about what is being done to address trauma and toxic stress in Philadelphia. “Four years ago, on a train from Philadelphia to Washington, Sandra Bloom told me about the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study. I hadn’t heard of it, and was astounded to learn about strong connections it found between exposure to trauma and toxic stress in childhood, and experiencing behavioral, social, emotional, and health problems as an adult. I told almost everyone I knew. I circulated the study’s publications among my public health peers. Hardly any of them had heard of it in 2011, when I wrote the first of several related posts.”</li>

Under the umbrella of the <em>Global Campaign for Violence Prevention (GCVP)</em>, VPA participants intend to strengthen support for data-driven violence prevention programmes based on the public health approach and ecological framework outlined in the World report on violence and health (WRVH) and to facilitate implementation of the WRVH recommendations. VPA participants are committed to adopting a <a href="http://www.who.int/violenceprevention/approach/public_health/en/" target="_blank">public health approach</a> to interpersonal violence prevention and to participating in consensus-determined activities to promote further adoption of this approach.</li>

Report from the CDC. Balaju AB, Claussen AH, Smith DC, Visser SN, Morales MJ, Perou R. 2007. The link between social networks and mental health has increasingly been recognized by public health as an important topic of interest. In this paper, we explore this association among a specific group: mothers. Specifically, we discuss how maternal mental health can be understood in the context of social networks, the influence of specific social relationships, and how the type and quality of support can mediate maternal mental health outcomes. We review interventions that foster social networks to address maternal mental health as well as other related health outcomes. Findings suggest that interventions that combine multiple treatment approaches may be more effective in addressing mental health. Also, traditional measures of social networks may not be appropriate for vulnerable populations, with qualitative, rather than quantitative, indicators of social networks being more predictive of maternal health and well-being. The implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.</li>

Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. 2007;48(3): 392-411. This paper focuses on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of violent traumatization and (a) describes the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examines the opportunities for, as well as the barriers to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critiques current national policies that militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.</li>

It has been central to conducting all of my clinical work with patients; informs all of the teaching and supervision I do as a professor of child and adult psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine; and it has been the basis for developing new treatment approaches that might benefit a substantial number of children and families who are deeply impacted by trauma that results from their exposure to violence and other catastrophic events.</li>

Covington T. Child Welfare. 2013;92(2): 21-39. Over the past 50 years, most major advances in child maltreatment have focused on protecting severely maltreated children and punishing perpetrators. This article argues that it is time to rigorously apply a public health framework to improve our understanding of, and accelerate efforts to, prevent child abuse and neglect. The article describes the fundamentals of a public health approach; discusses how this approach has been applied to improve surveillance of serious maltreatment injuries and fatalities, the understanding of risk and protective factors, and the long-term consequences of maltreatment; and describes how a public health approach is an effective means to prevention.</li>

The first edition of this book set the standard for high-quality intervention and prevention programs in early childhood practice. Once again making complex psychological concepts available to classroom teachers, this thorough revision: (1) incorporates important understandings gained since the tragic events of 9/11; (2) addresses many of the challenging issues that confront educators in the current high-pressure climate focused on academic performance; (3) includes recent scientific research that supports the concepts underlying high-quality intervention and prevention in early childhood practice-concepts that were the basis for the first edition of this book; and (4) provides an essential framework to help teachers understand the emotional lives of the young children they serve.</li>
