Many children in the nation’s foster care system – nearly one in three – use behavioral health services. This population represents only three percent of all children in Medicaid, but 15 percent of those using behavioral health services and 29 percent of Medicaid expenditures for children’s behavioral health services. This infographic from the Center for Health Care Strategies (CHCS) compares behavioral health care use and expense for Medicaid-enrolled children in general vs. those in foster care.

When people learn about the ACE Study, they have a range of reactions, from sorrow to outrage to relief at having a framework—finally—that explains their own or others’ behavior. Then they ask, “What can I do?” This cookbook aims to answer that question. Whether you are the director of a YMCA, the head of a county health department, a sheriff, a school principal, a pediatrician or a parent, it will offer you context, definitions and questions to help you think about building resilience where you live. It will describe how communities in the United States and Canada are putting the theories of ACEs and resilience into practice.</li>

It teaches children to self-regulate, to work together for common goals, and to focus on a positive future they co-create with others. These are core cognitive, emotional, and behavioral skills required for peaceful, productive, healthy and happy lives.  PAX is not a classroom or behavior management program, yet has the benefit of making any classroom easier to manage. PAX reduces teacher and staff stress, and brings back joy into the classroom every day—while increasing time for meaningful instruction and learning.

Philadelphia Inquirer (Blog), Jonathan Purtle, 03/21/2014. This blog is part of a serious of posts about what is being done to address trauma and toxic stress in Philadelphia. “Four years ago, on a train from Philadelphia to Washington, Sandra Bloom told me about the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study. I hadn’t heard of it, and was astounded to learn about strong connections it found between exposure to trauma and toxic stress in childhood, and experiencing behavioral, social, emotional, and health problems as an adult. I told almost everyone I knew. I circulated the study’s publications among my public health peers. Hardly any of them had heard of it in 2011, when I wrote the first of several related posts.”</li>

Mental Health First Aid uses role-playing and simulations to demonstrate how to assess a mental health crisis; select interventions and provide initial help; and connect young people to professional, peer, social, and self-help care.</li>

(PDF, 917KB). Seclusion and restraint are interventions currently permitted for use in mental health services to control or manage a person&rsquo;s behavior. In Australia, serious concerns about the use of such seclusion and restraint have been raised at least since 1993. Consumers and their supporters have also expressed strong views about the harm of these practices. This paper presents the results of ten focus group discussions with people with lived experience of mental health issues and also carers, family members and support persons in relation to the use of seclusion and restraint.</li>

(PDF, 390.55KB). This book authored by the Committee on Post-Disaster Recovery of a Community's Public Health, Medical, and Social Services, the Board on Health Sciences Policy, and the&nbsp;Institute of Medicine&nbsp;of the National Academies can be downloaded for free or read on-line. In the devastation that follows a major disaster, public, private, and charitable sources spend billions of dollars from to help communities recover. National rhetoric often characterizes these efforts as a &ldquo;return to normal.&rdquo; Yet for many American communities, pre-disaster conditions are far from optimal. Large segments of the US population suffer from preventable health problems, experience inequitable access to services, and rely on overburdened health systems. A return to pre-event conditions in such cases may be shortsighted given the high costs—both economic and social—of poor health. This book makes the case that disaster recovery should be guided by a community vi­sion, where health considerations are integrated into all aspects of recovery planning before and after a disaster and funding streams are leveraged in a coordinated manner and applied to health improvement priorities in order to meet human recovery needs and create healthy built and natural environments.</li>

(PDF, 819KB). In this webinar, Dr. David Finkelhor discusses a devastating impact of sexual abuse on young victims and how the violent or sexual victimization of children can often lead to an intergenerational cycle of violence and abuse. The uncertainty about the meaning of this trend underscores how much remains to be accomplished in terms of drawing lessons from past experience to determine future policy and prevention of sexual abuse of children.</li>

(PDF, 585KB). Hieger, J, Ariyakulkan L, Serdjenian, T. National Resource Center for Permanency and Family Connections. December 2012. Federal legislation can support diagnosis and treatment of PTSD among children in foster care. A provision of The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 requires all states to increase their oversight of the health and mental health of foster care children, including initial and follow up health assessments to determine whether a child needs additional help. This document highlights states that have amended their policies and implemented programs to meet these legislative mandates.</li>

Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. 2007;48(3): 392-411. This paper focuses on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of violent traumatization and (a) describes the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examines the opportunities for, as well as the barriers to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critiques current national policies that militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.</li>

Marans S. International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies. 2013;10(3): 247-266. Throughout my career, psychoanalytic training has always served three invaluable roles or functions. It has been central to conducting all of my clinical work with patients; informs all of the teaching and supervision I do as a professor of child and adult psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine; and it has been the basis for developing new treatment approaches that might benefit a substantial number of children and families who are deeply impacted by trauma that results from their exposure to violence and other catastrophic events.</li>

Covington T. Child Welfare. 2013;92(2): 21-39. Over the past 50 years, most major advances in child maltreatment have focused on protecting severely maltreated children and punishing perpetrators. This article argues that it is time to rigorously apply a public health framework to improve our understanding of, and accelerate efforts to, prevent child abuse and neglect. The article describes the fundamentals of a public health approach; discusses how this approach has been applied to improve surveillance of serious maltreatment injuries and fatalities, the understanding of risk and protective factors, and the long-term consequences of maltreatment; and describes how a public health approach is an effective means to prevention.</li>

The first edition of this book set the standard for high-quality intervention and prevention programs in early childhood practice. Once again making complex psychological concepts available to classroom teachers, this thorough revision: (1) incorporates important understandings gained since the tragic events of 9/11; (2) addresses many of the challenging issues that confront educators in the current high-pressure climate focused on academic performance; (3) includes recent scientific research that supports the concepts underlying high-quality intervention and prevention in early childhood practice-concepts that were the basis for the first edition of this book; and (4) provides an essential framework to help teachers understand the emotional lives of the young children they serve.</li>
