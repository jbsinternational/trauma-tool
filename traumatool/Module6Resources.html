NBC Nightly News covers the story of a soldier who searched for resources to explain his PTSD to his children, but found the options lacking. So, he wrote a book for his family but hopes it will help other military families as well. In "Why Is Dad So Mad?" a family of lions — representing the Kastle family — is battling to overcome the father lion's PTSD. In the book's colorful pages, the father lion is shown with a raging fire inside his chest. That image, and its message, made an impact on Kastle's 6-year-old daughter, Raegan. "No matter what, when they're mad or sad at you, they still love you," explained Raegan, admiring her father's book in her playroom. "There's always a fire in his heart, but no matter what, I know there's love." The book is available now at www.kastlebooks.com.</li>

Bruce D. Perry and Maia Szalavitz. In beautifully written, fascinating accounts of experiences working with emotionally stunted and traumatized children, child psychiatrist Perry educates readers about how early-life stress and violence affects the developing brain. He offers simple yet vivid illustrations of the stress response and the brain's mechanisms with facts and images that crystallize in the mind without being too detailed or confusing. He emphasizes that the brain of a traumatized child can be remolded with patterned, repetitive experiences in a safe environment. Most importantly, as such trauma involves the shattering of human connections, "lasting, caring connections to others" are irreplaceable in healing; medications and therapy alone cannot do the job.</li>

Sherman and DeAnne M. Sherman. This guide is an invaluable tool in the hands of those so often forgotten in dealing with trauma: the teenagers who are confused and frightened by what is happening. Part One of Finding My Way clearly explains PTSD and other common responses to trauma, reviews co-occurring problems (including addictive behavior), and describes numerous treatment options. Part Two gently encourages readers to address their own strong emotions including anger, fear, confusion, sadness, and shame. Readers are then guided through the process of learning valuable coping tools, identifying their social support network, and figuring out how to deal with their friends. Part Three includes frequently asked questions, a glossary, and an extensive resource list. This honest and respectfully written manual serves as a roadmap for teens who are trying to find their way.</li>

In these personal reflections on his thirty years of clinical work with victims of genocide, torture, and abuse in the United States, Cambodia, Bosnia, and other parts of the world, Richard Mollica describes the surprising capacity of traumatized people to heal themselves. Healing Invisible Wounds reveals how trauma survivors, through the telling of their stories, teach all of us how to deal with the tragic events of everyday life. Mollica's important discovery that humiliation--an instrument of violence that also leads to anger and despair--can be transformed through his therapeutic project into solace and redemption is a remarkable new contribution to survivors and clinicians.</li>

Penguin Group USA, 1994. A gifted child therapist explores the impact of homelessness on her young clients, and helps them recover their inner lives buried by crisis, poverty, and despair. The Way Home explores these issues as it tells the riveting stories of Qimmy, a wide-eyed and pretty three-year-old, raised on a subway platform, and Opal, her non-verbal, homeless mother, on a mission to get her daughter admitted to a day-care center; Ronnie, a thirteen-year-old girl who has become phobic to attend school and is terrified of homeless women in the subway, until dream images connect her to early memories and family secrets, and ultimately allow her to overcome her fears; Angie, 'Mitri, Raquel, Kendra and Maimai, kindergartners who work to build "homes" within themselves that are strong enough to protect them from the violence in their daily lives, including crack-addicted mothers and abusive fathers.</li>
