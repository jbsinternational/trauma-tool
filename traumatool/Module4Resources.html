Williams M., Carson M., Zamora I., Harley E.K, Lakatos P.P. Pragmatic Case Studies in Psychotherapy. 2014; 10(3):212-226. Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), an evidence-based dyadic treatment for young children who have experienced trauma, shows promise in intervening with children with developmental disabilities, as illustrated in the cases we described of 14-month-old "James" and 6-year-2-month-old "Juan." In their thoughtful commentary on these cases, Ghosh Ippen, Noroña, & Lieberman (2014) discuss additional clinical considerations important to the use of CPP with this population. In a second response, Williams and co-authors explore further implementation of CPP in the context of the developmental disability and medical service systems. They highlight the importance of resilience in parents’ responses to their child’s developmental disability, contributions from pediatric psychology to understanding pediatric medical traumatic stress, infusing relationship-based approaches in collaboration with other service systems, and addressing barriers to service access in ethnic minority families. Finally, they provide recommendations for training and fidelity monitoring when applying CPP to children with developmental disabilities and their families.</li>

Aarons GA, Green AE, Palinkas LA, et al. Implementation Science. 2012;7(31):1-9. This paper describes a study of the feasibility and acceptability of an implementation approach, the Dynamic Adaptation Process (DAP), designed to allow for evidence-based practice (EBP) adaptation and system and organizational adaptations in a planned and considered, rather than ad hoc, way. The DAP involves identifying core elements and adaptable characteristics of an EBP, then supporting implementation with specific training on allowable adaptations to the model, fidelity monitoring and support, and identifying the need for and solutions to system and organizational adaptations. In addition, this study addresses a secondary concern, that of improving EBP model fidelity assessment and feedback in real-world settings.</li>

Journal of EMDR Practice and Research. 2009;3(4):264-278. The diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) covers a wide range of conditions, ranging from patients suffering from a one-time traumatic accident to those who have been exposed to chronic traumatization and repeated assaults beginning at an early age. This article examines the body of literature on the treatment of complex PTSD and chronically traumatized populations, with a focus on EMDR treatment and research. A phase-oriented EMDR model for working with these patients is presented, highlighting the role of resource development and installation (RDI) and other strategies that address the needs of patients with compromised affect tolerance and self-regulation. EMDR treatment goals, procedures, and adaptations for each of the various treatment phases (stabilization, trauma processing, reconnection/development of self-identity) are reviewed. Finally, reflections on the strengths and unique advantages of EMDR in treating complex PTSD are offered along with suggestions for future investigations.</li>

(PDF, 459KB). Choate, M.L, Pincus, D.B., Eyberg, S.M., & Barlow, D.H. Cognitive and Behavioral Practice. 2005;12: 126-135. This article describes a pilot study to apply Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) to the treatment of separation anxiety disorder (SAD). The results of this study support research delineating the important contribution of family factors to anxiety in childhood. Several mechanisms are proposed that may account for the dramatic decrease in separation-anxious behaviors seen in children during PCIT, including increased levels of child control, increases social reinforcement of brave behaviors, improved parent-child attachment, and decreased levels of parent anxiety. Results of this study provide promising initial evidence that PCIT may be efficacious for treating young children with SAD.</li>

Bessel van deer Kolk has spent over 3 decades working with survivors. In this book, he transforms our understanding of traumatic stress, revealing how it literally rearranges the brain's wiring - specifically areas dedicated to pleasure, engagement, control and trust. He shows how these areas can be reactivated through innovative treatments including neurofeedback, mindfulness techniques, play, yoga, and other therapies. Based on Dr. Van der Kolk's own research and that of other leading specialists, "The Body Keeps the Score” offers proven alternatives to drugs and talk therapy - and a way to reclaim lives.</li>

Allen, B., Gharagozloo L., & Johnson , J.C. Child Maltreatment. 2011; 17(1): 11-21. The study reports on the results of a nationwide survey of 262 clinicians serving maltreated children in the United States. From a provided list, clinicians were asked to identify interventions they believed possessed adequate empirical support, as well as the interventions they commonly used, were trained to use, or would like to receive training to use. Results showed that clinicians generally are unable to identify empirically-supported treatments (ESTs), and many of the interventions clinicians reported most commonly using and being trained to use are not typically considered to be empirically-supported (with the exception of Trauma-Focused Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy. Implications of these findings for dissemination and policy are discussed.</li>

Curr Psychiatry Rep. 2013;15(1):332. This article reviews recent advances in empirically supported psychotherapeutic treatments for children and adolescents experiencing trauma and provides a brief summary of available interventions, as well as a context for their use. This article highlights the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry’s recent practice guidelines for trauma treatment and discusses their implications for clinicians, including the benefits of involving caregivers in treatment and the rationale for using practices that are specifically trauma-focused as first-line intervention. The authors also discuss the status of research on the real-world implementation of these therapies and the need for further research, particularly regarding clinician knowledge and use of empirically supported practices, potential stepped-care approaches to trauma treatment, and the need to reduce attrition in child trauma research and practice.</li>

Dittmann, I., & Jensen, T.K. Child Abuse & Neglect. 2013. The objective of this study was to explore traumatized youths’ experiences of receiving TF-CBT. Findings showed how an initial fear of talking about traumatic events and not knowing what to expect from therapy was reduced when the youth experienced the therapist as empathetic and knowledgeable. Talking to the therapist was experienced as positive because of the therapist's expertise, neutrality, empathy, and confidentiality. Talking about the trauma was perceived as difficult but also as most helpful. Learning skills for reducing stress was also perceived as helpful. Important change processes were described as resuming normal functioning and getting “back on track,”, or as acquiring new perspectives and “moving forward.”</li>

BigFoot D.S., & Funderburk, B.W. Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. 2014;43(4):309-318. The Indian Country Child Trauma Center, as part of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, designed a series of American Indian and Alaska Native transformations of evidence-based treatment models. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) was culturally adapted/translated to provide an effective treatment model for parents who have difficulty with appropriate parenting skills or for their children who have problematic behavior. The model, Honoring Children-Making Relatives, embeds the basic tenets and procedures of PCIT in a framework that supports American Indian and Alaska Native traditional beliefs and parenting practices that regard children as being the center of the Circle. This article provides an overview of the Honoring Children-Making Relatives model, reviews cultural considerations incorporated into ICCTC's model transformation process, and discusses specific applications for Parent-Child Interaction Therapy within the model.</li>

Amaya-Jackson L and DeRosa RR. Journal of Traumatic Stress. 2007;20(4):379-390. Professionals in the child trauma field, eager to bring best practices to children and their families who have suffered from traumatic life events, have developed a number of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) and promising practices available for adoption and implementation into community practice. Clinicians and researchers alike have raised questions about "if, when, and how" these EBTs can be applied to some of the more complex trauma presentations seen in real world practice. The authors take an evidence-based practice approach, including critical appraisal of clients' unique needs and preferences, utilizing applicable trauma treatment core components and current EBTs, and emphasizing monitoring strategies of client progress, particularly when needing to adapt EBTs for select clients.</li>

Strengthening Family Coping Resources (SFCR) uses a skill-building, multi-family group framework to teach constructive resources to families who have a high exposure to stress and trauma. As an intervention for high-risk families, SFCR can cause a reduction in symptoms of traumatic distress and behavior problems and help families demonstrate higher functioning. The SFCR manual is based on a systemic, family approach and uses empirically-supported trauma treatment that focuses on family ritual, storytelling, and narration, which improves communication and understanding within family members. The manual is organized into three accessible parts: 1) theoretical and empirical foundations of SFCR, 2) implementation and the clinical guidelines for conducting SFCR 3) session guidelines focused on the multi-family group versions of SFCR.</li>
