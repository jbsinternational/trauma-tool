Maier S.F. 2014. Neurobiology of Stress. Recently, it has become clear that the experience of behavioral control over adverse events produces enduring changes that reduce the effects of subsequent negative events, even if they are uncontrollable and quite different from the original event controlled. This review focuses on the mechanism by which control both limits the impact of the stressor being experienced and produces enduring, trans-situational “immunization”. Importantly, the joint occurrence of control and adverse events seems to produce enduring plastic changes in the topedown inhibitory mPFC system such that this system is now activated by later adverse events even if they are uncontrollable, thereby reducing the impact of these events. Other issues are discussed that include a) whether other processes such as safety signals and exercise, that lead to resistance/resilience, also use the mPFC circuitry or do so in other ways; b) whether control has similar effects and neural mediation in humans, and c) the relationship of this work to clinical phenomena.</li>

Mehta D et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences. 2013;110(20:8302-8307. This study shows that PTSD patients who were abused as children have different patterns of DNA methylation and gene expression compared to those that were not abused as children. 98% of the changes in gene expression patterns in the PTSD patients with childhood abuse did not overlap with those found in PTSD patients without childhood abuse. The researchers also found that epigenetic marks associated with gene expression changes were 12-fold higher in PTSD patients with a history of childhood abuse. These findings suggest that we need to rethink our classifications of PTSD, and therefore tailor treatment to each patient and his or her experiences.</li>

McEven, B.S., Gray, J.D., & Nasca, C. 2014. Neurobiology of Stress. As the central organ of stress and adaptation to stressors, the brain plays a pivotal role in behavioral and physiological responses that may lead to successful adaptation or to pathophysiology and mental and physical disease. In this context, resilience can be defined as “achieving a positive outcome in the face of adversity”. The goal is to recognize those biological changes that underlie flexible adaptability, and to recognize gene pathways, epigenetic factors and structural changes that indicate lack of resilience leading to negative outcomes, particularly when the individual is challenged by new circumstances. Early life experiences determine individual differences in such capabilities via epigenetic pathways and laying down of brain architecture that determine the later capacity for flexible adaptation or the lack thereof. Reactivation of such plasticity in individuals lacking such resilience is a new challenge for research and practical application. Finally, sex differences in the plasticity of the brain are often overlooked and must be more fully investigated.</li>
