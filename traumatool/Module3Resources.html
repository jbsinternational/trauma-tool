Zoldbrod AP. Current Sexual Health Reports. 2015; 7:3-11. The effect of interpersonal trauma on sexuality can be profound. The field of sexual trauma is complex empirically and clinically, with contradictory theories and conflicting data. Research definitions and treatment protocols for child sexual abuse are very imprecise. There are no firm, empirically proven guidelines for treating men and women who have been sexually abused as children or adolescents. Overt sexual abuse (OSA) in children and adolescents is defined here as molestation, rape, or incest. Research has shown that OSA may, but does not necessarily, lead to sexual dysfunction in adulthood. Strategies to assess and treat OSA are reviewed. Body Maps are recommended to assess and treat sexual trauma.</li>

Hopper EK, Bassuk EL, Olivet J. 2010. The Open Health Services and Policy Journal. Research has shown that individuals who are homeless are likely to have experienced some form of previous trauma; homelessness itself can be viewed as a traumatic experience; and being homeless increases the risk of further victimization and retraumatization. Historically, homeless service settings have provided care to traumatized people without directly acknowledging or addressing the impact of trauma. As the field advances, providers in homeless service settings are beginning to realize the opportunity that they have to not only respond to the immediate crisis of homelessness, but to also contribute to the longer-term healing of these individuals. This paper explores the evidence base for Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) within homelessness service settings, including a review of quantitative and qualitative studies and other supporting literature.</li>

It is designed to meet agencies and communities where they are at, and to build on established successes.  TIAA data guides change according to each organization’s unique strengths and needs. The assessment can be adapted for single or multi-agency use and its language modified to suit agency norms. Programs can be added to it that reflect a full service array, e.g., multi‐systemic therapy, substance abuse, co‐occurring, or day treatment services.  Where data already exists on an environment’s physical and emotional safety, youth and family empowerment, trustworthiness, trauma competence or cultural competence, components of the TIAA can be used to enhance existing data collection.</li>

This volume identifies the essential elements necessary for a system to begin to integrate an understanding about trauma into its core service programs. The fundamental elements of a trauma-informed system are identified and the necessary supports for bringing about system change are highlighted. The basic philosophy of trauma-informed practice is then examined across several specific service components: assessment and screening, inpatient treatment, residential services, addictions programming, and case management. Modifications necessary to transform a current system into a trauma-informed system are discussed in great detail as well as the changing roles of consumers and providers.
