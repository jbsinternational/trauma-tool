A landmark Welsh study has revealed the extent to which traumatic experiences - from divorce to abuse - affect a child's physical and mental development.<strong> </strong>According to this study being exposed to difficult experiences as a young person alters how children&rsquo;s brains grow and how their immune and hormone systems develop. Additionally, cancer, heart disease, mental illness, drug use, smoking, binge drinking and criminality in adulthood can all develop as a result..</li>

<li><a href="http://acesconnection.com/" target="_blank">ACEs Connection</a>. The ACEs Connection is a community practice network.

<li><a href="https://acestoohigh.com/2016/01/09/lumpers-and-splitters-who-doesnt-believe-in-aces/" target="_blank">ACEs: We need to communicate in a way that reaches all people.</a> This blog suggests that Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (ACES) would make better sense if it was addressed on an individual level. Government agencies typically concentrate on non-narrative communications, that is, arguments focusing on logic, science and research and avoiding the personal story. Adding a personal narrative however allows us to appeal to people on multiple levels. It gives us a chance to show how the desire to take personal responsibility can be frustrated by the lack of reasonable access and opportunity. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.acesconnection.com/blog/adding-layers-to-the-aces-pyramid-what-do-you-think" target="_blank">Adding Layers to the ACE Pyramid-What Do You Think?</a> The RYSE Youth Center in California is looking for opinions about their new conceptualization of the ACE Pyramid.  Last year, the RYSE youth center In California did a listening campaign with its youth, and earlier this year, staff members began talking about the findings and sharing them with activists, researchers, funders, etc. They decided to use the ACEs pyramid to leverage the existing science in communicating their major findings: that in helping young people, especially young people of color, there’s only so much that an organization like RYSE can do. It requires transformation at systems and community levels. The two new layers of the ACE pyramid – social conditions/local context and generational embodiment/historical trauma -- address that.   </li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm" target="_blank">Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE)</a> study is one of the largest investigations ever conducted to assess associations between childhood maltreatment and later-life health and well-being. The study is an ongoing collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kaiser Permanente's Health Appraisal Clinic in San Diego. More than 17,000 Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) members undergoing a comprehensive physical examination chose to provide detailed information about their childhood experience of abuse, neglect, and family dysfunction. To date, more than 50 scientific articles have been published and more than 100 conference and workshop presentations have been made.</li>

This article discussed a recent study published in The Journal of Interpersonal Violence, which found that girls who experience physical abuse as children tend to internalize their feelings and are often quiet and withdrawn, whereas abused boys more often tend to act out aggressively, getting into fights and trouble at school. Surprisingly, it was the girls who were withdrawn as children who were most likely later to exhibit antisocial behavior — reporting a pattern of abusive relationships and engaging in criminal activity — as adults.</li>

Hair samples may help determine the risk of a child developing mental and other chronic illnesses later in their life, research led by the University of Melbourne has found. Cortisol is known as the “stress hormone” because it is released in response to acute stress to help the body react and cope. The greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced, such as divorce, injury, moving house, severe illness or the death of a family member, the higher the hair cortisol concentrations were, the researchers found.</li>

<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/109042767" target="_blank">Explaining the Brain to Children and Adolescents</a>. Dr. Allison Sampson Jackson draws from Dr. Dan Siegel, the Hawn Foundation, Joseph LeDoux and many others who have helped to understand the importance of knowing and sharing with others the ways in which the “upstairs” and “downstairs” brain impact our ability to learn and change behavior. This video combines the learning from these 3 sources to demonstrate in “layman’s” terms how to help ourselves, teens, and young children understand their upstairs and downstairs brains and what happens when we experience a threat. Dr. Jackson also highlights how calming strategies, such as mindfulness, impact the different parts of the brain. </li>

<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/sexual-abuse-victims-obesity/420186/" target="_blank">The Second Assault</a>. Victims of childhood sexual abuse are far more likely to become obese adults. New research shows that early trauma is so damaging that it can disrupt a person&rsquo;s entire psychology and metabolism. An analysis of 57,000 women found that those who experienced physical or sexual abuse as children were twice as likely to be addicted to food. Women actually said they felt more physically imposing when they were bigger, which would help them ward off potential sexual advances from men.</li>

Maier S.F. 2014. Neurobiology of Stress. Recently, it has become clear that the experience of behavioral control over adverse events produces enduring changes that reduce the effects of subsequent negative events, even if they are uncontrollable and quite different from the original event controlled. This review focuses on the mechanism by which control both limits the impact of the stressor being experienced and produces enduring, trans-situational “immunization”. Importantly, the joint occurrence of control and adverse events seems to produce enduring plastic changes in the topedown inhibitory mPFC system such that this system is now activated by later adverse events even if they are uncontrollable, thereby reducing the impact of these events. Other issues are discussed that include a) whether other processes such as safety signals and exercise, that lead to resistance/resilience, also use the mPFC circuitry or do so in other ways; b) whether control has similar effects and neural mediation in humans, and c) the relationship of this work to clinical phenomena.</li>

(PDF, 686KB). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Herringa RJ, Birn RM, Ruttle PL, Burghy CA, Stodola DE, Davidson RJ, et al. (2013). This study shows that maltreatment predicts lower prefrontal–hippocampal connectivity in females and males but lower prefrontal–amygdala connectivity only in females. Altered connectivity is shown to mediate the development of internalizing symptoms. The results highlight the importance of fronto–hippocampal connectivity for both sexes in internalizing symptoms following maltreatment. The additional impact on fronto–amygdala connectivity in females may help explain their higher risk for anxiety and depression.</li>

McEven, B.S., Gray, J.D., & Nasca, C. 2014. Neurobiology of Stress. As the central organ of stress and adaptation to stressors, the brain plays a pivotal role in behavioral and physiological responses that may lead to successful adaptation or to pathophysiology and mental and physical disease. In this context, resilience can be defined as “achieving a positive outcome in the face of adversity”. The goal is to recognize those biological changes that underlie flexible adaptability, and to recognize gene pathways, epigenetic factors and structural changes that indicate lack of resilience leading to negative outcomes, particularly when the individual is challenged by new circumstances. Early life experiences determine individual differences in such capabilities via epigenetic pathways and laying down of brain architecture that determine the later capacity for flexible adaptation or the lack thereof. Reactivation of such plasticity in individuals lacking such resilience is a new challenge for research and practical application. Finally, sex differences in the plasticity of the brain are often overlooked and must be more fully investigated.</li>

Pamela C. Alexander. This book published in December 2014 explores the conditions under which children, as a function of their own abuse, become abusive themselves. That experiences from childhood affect our behavior in adulthood, especially in the ways we treat our children and intimate partners, is generally accepted. Indeed, theories of intergenerational transmission of violence indicate that if we ourselves have been abused and neglected as children, we will likely be abusive and neglectful to others close to us—thus extending the cycle across generations. However, many individuals who were maltreated as children do not replicate this cycle, and such models make little sense of the individual raised in a “good family” who is violent either as a child or as an adult. These discontinuities of cycles of violence and trauma have challenged professionals and nonprofessionals alike. However, broadening our vision and attending to new areas of research can help to illuminate this conundrum and open up new avenues of intervention. In this book, Pamela Alexander does just that.</li>

Journal of Traumatic Stress. 2007;20(1):39-51. This study explored the relationship between trauma and past parental attachment behaviors of 41 expectant mothers and the subsequent development of attachment and bonding with their unborn child. Results suggest that trauma history, in general, does not negatively impact expectant mothers' current prenatal attachment with their unborn child. However, interpersonal trauma history does appear to have negative effects on prenatal attachment. These results point to the importance of understanding the role of interpersonal trauma exposure on prenatal attachment</li>
