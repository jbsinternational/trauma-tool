That's something the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ymcachicago.org/programs/youth-safety-and-violence-prevention-programs#urbanwarriors">Urban Warriors program</a>&nbsp;is trying to change.

  <li>The <a href="http://www.chapinhall.org/may14policyforum" target="_blank">Child and Family Policy Forum</a>, May 14, 2013. The forum discusses findings from a Chapin Hall report in which researchers identified a subset of parents involved with the child welfare system who have experienced extensive childhood trauma and face multiple challenges or service needs. These findings have implications for caseworker engagement and service interventions, and they also raise fundamental questions about our obligation and approaches to working with parents, protecting children, and promoting well-being. The forum also discusses changes to policies and practices in the child welfare, legal, and human services fields that may be necessary to improve the well-being of this group of children and their families.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.communityconnectionsdc.org/web/page/673/interior.html" target="_blank">Creating Cultures of Trauma-Informed Care (CCIT) model</a>. Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC) developed over the last ten years by Community Connections, draws substantially on Using Trauma Theory to Design Service Systems, a book edited by Maxine Harris, Ph.D., and Roger Fallot, Ph.D. (2001).  Used by state service systems and provider organizations, this work presents a step-by-step model for state mental health, substance abuse, and other public human service systems, public and private provider agencies, and individual services and programs to become “trauma-informed.”  The model provides guidelines for evaluating and modifying all system and service components in light of a basic understanding of the role that violence plays in the lives of people seeking mental health and addictions services, most of whom have been traumatically impacted by unaddressed histories of sexual and physical abuse and other violence.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.lanthorn.com/article/2015/11/documentary-highlights-the-struggle-of-dealing-with-trauma">Documentary highlights the struggles of dealing with trauma.</strong></a> Grand Valley State University held a free screening of the new film for students. The documentary, directed by James Redford, delves into trauma-informed education and the Adverse Childhood Experience Study (ACES). The film follows students at Lincoln High School, an alternative high school in Walla Walla, Washington, for a year. Many of the students at the school struggle with ACES. The film follows Lincoln&rsquo;s staff as they try a different approach to how they discipline students. The new approach is based in understanding and treatment, rather than traditional punishment with detention or suspension.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.inlander.com/spokane/fighting-trauma/Content?oid=2626986" target="_blank">Fighting Trauma.</a> Research shows that building resilience&nbsp;in children through creating environments that are stable, as well as emotionally and physically safe, can help counteract the effects of their previous adverse experiences. However, it can be hard for even well-meaning caregivers who don't fully understand the effects of trauma to respond effectively to kids' needs. The Spokane Regional Health District has developed a user-friendly toolkit for teachers, parents and daycare providers, which helps all the caretakers to respond to trauma with sensitivity.</li>
  <li><a href="http://garbagebagsuitcase.blogspot.com/2016/01/how-grief-goes-unnoticed-in-foster.html" target="_blank">How Grief Goes Unnoticed in Foster Children: And the Underlying Trauma that it Causes. </a>If a small girl is pulled from her mother&rsquo;s home, only to be placed in the safety of strangers, and she attends school later that week, only to throw something at another student or even the teacher, is she grieving or a troublemaker? Foster children have often suffered a tremendous loss — a deep sadness and grief that often goes unrecognized, and often leads to deeper traumas. When we learn to recognize that a child may be grieving, it may be easier to throw our arms around them and tell them everything is going to be OK, instead of issuing a punishment.</li>

It's been three years since a gunman forced his way into a Newtown, Conn., elementary school and killed 20 young children and six staff members before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life as police responded to the scene. The shootings were a catalyst for discussions that continue today about schools' responsibility to keep students safe. For many educators, those discussions have led to a broader understanding of what safety means for students—both physically and emotionally.</li>

  <li><a href="http://gainscenter.samhsa.gov/trauma/trauma_training.asp" target="_blank">Trauma Training - SAMHSA’s GAINS Center for Behavioral Health and Justice Transformation</a>. Although prevalence estimates vary, there is consensus that high percentages of justice-involved women and men have experienced serious trauma throughout their lifetime. The reverberating effects of trauma experiences can challenge a person’s capacity for recovery and pose significant barriers to accessing services, often resulting in an increased risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system. To raise awareness about trauma and its effects among criminal justice professionals, SAMHSA’s GAINS Center developed a half-day training curriculum for criminal justice professionals: How Being Trauma-Informed Improves Criminal Justice System Responses.</li>

For example, chronic separations may result from military deployment, parental incarceration, immi­gration, parental deportation, or termination of parental rights. When sep­arated from their caregiver, children may develop posttraumatic respons­es. The fact sheet gives information on traumatic separation, chal­lenges children may face, posttraumatic responses children may have, and suggestions for helping children who experience traumatic separa­tion from a caregiver.</li>

Seclusion and restraint are interventions currently permitted for use in mental health services to control or manage a person&rsquo;s behavior. In Australia, serious concerns about the use of such seclusion and restraint have been raised at least since 1993. Consumers and their supporters have also expressed strong views about the harm of these practices. This paper presents the results of ten focus group discussions with people with lived experience of mental health issues and also careers, family members and support persons in relation to the use of seclusion and restraint.</li>

Griffin G, McClelland G, Holzberg M, Stolbach B, Mai N, Kisiel C. Child Welfare. 2011;90(6),69-89.

In this study, 14,000 clinical assessments from Child Welfare in Illinois were analyzed. Based on the results, three recommendations are made-1) trauma screening and assessments are conducted of all youth in child welfare, 2) evidence-based, trauma-focused treatment begin when a child demonstrates a trauma-related symptom, and 3) clinicians should not diagnose a child with a mental illness without first addressing the impact of trauma.</li>
